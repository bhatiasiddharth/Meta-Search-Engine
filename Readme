Initially environment must be set by typing
-->source env/bin/activate
This is for retrieving the documents using Google Scraper. Had created a virtual environment for the python file

Run
-->python config.py
This will generate the documents in keyword_google.txt and keyword_yahoo.txt

Then compile
-->g++ 2011B4A7680P.cpp -std=gnu++11
Run
-->./a.out
This is the code for aggregating the documents, ranking and then evaluating the ranking

Can change the keyword both in .cpp and .py files
